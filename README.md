# INFSCI1061-Project1: Asteroid Defender
The year is 2265. Recently, a strange phenomenon has been occuring in the space around the asteroid belt. Asteroids have been flying out of the belt pointed straight at Earth, as if being thrown by some unknown prescence. The Earth Space Defence Corp can barely keep up with the number of asteroids being thrown at our planet, and it's only a matter of time before one of them strikes Earth. You are part of an elite ESDC special-ops team, and you have been sent straight at the source of a strange gravitational anomaly that may be the cause of the recent trouble. Can you find the source of the disturbance and put a stop to this threat to Earth while destroying as many asteroids as possible along the way? Find out in Asteroid Defender!

# Features:
Blast your way through outer space destroying as many asteroids as possible, but be careful! Larger asteroids may not be destroyed in one shot, instead breaking into smaller asteroids!

Score points for each asteroid destroyed, and collect energy along the way to recover your shields and keep fighting!

Battle a mysterious alien space ship in deep space that can control the gravity around it to fling asteroids at you at a breakneck pace!

# Controls:
Use the W and S keys to move your ship up and down on the screen, and fire your laser with the space bar!
